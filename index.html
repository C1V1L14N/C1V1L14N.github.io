                <p>Software developer with 12 years experience in audio engineering. Having recently discovered a new passion for coding and technical learning, I am now looking for a role that allows me to combine both areas of creativity whilst striving for continuous development. I am inspired to continue expanding my technical skillset, to work on complex and interesting software applications and put my technical experience to use in a collaborative team. I bring a technical mindset as well as strong interpersonal, fault finding and problem solving skills to a team and I am motivated to work with my peers to achieve a common goal.</p>

                <div id="project-paragraph">
                    <p>This is my very first outing in coding. It is a basic application that would allow a comic shop employee or owner to track their inventory. Although the scope of the project is very small, this is where I learned fundamental aspects of coding. This was my first introduction into employing RESTful routes, persistent data amongst many other coding practices.</p>

                <div id="project-paragraph">
                    <p>Cosmodex is a Vue framework application I created as part of a team in our first group project at CodeClan. The focus of this project is the use of Vue with JavaScript for the front-end and Mongodb for the back-end. The application pulls data from a solar system API that we sorted and displayed in a simple but effective front end. The Cosmodex included animated buttons and planet icons that were designed and built from scratch. We also had a complete solar system simulation that was animated in pure CSS.</p>

                <div id="project-paragraph">
                    <p>Shop Local is an application built in React with Javascript with a Spring back-end using Java with the IDE IntelliJ. The brief was to create an application that allows local businesses that are suffering from restrictions due to Covid-19 to be able to provide customers with appointments for services or time slots to be able to visit shops when it becomes safe to do so. In this project I was responsible for designing and styling the user interface. I took inspiration from similar themed sites such as Just Eat, Etsy and Amazon. The main idea I wanted to commit to in our project was to recreate a boutique or small retailer feel to the site rather than overloaded pages like the bigger retailer sites.</p>
